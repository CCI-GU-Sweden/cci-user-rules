# CCI User Rules — {{VERSION}}

**All users are required to read and understand the following CCI User Rules and confirm their acceptance** in order to provide convenient and reliable access to high-quality imaging for as many people as possible while protecting both the users and the instruments from the consequences of any misuse.  

> **IMPORTANT**  
> These rules may be updated at any time without prior notice. In case of major changes, user will be notified by e-mail. It is the user’s responsibility to review the latest version before booking or using CCI resources. The latest version will be made available on the CCI website.

## 1. **Acknowledgement of the CCI in Publications**

Acknowledgements are of the utmost importance for the CCI, as publications from our users are a major hallmark for the impact and importance of a facility. They prove the effective use of the CCI resources to university executives and research networks, and are a prerequisite for the success of the CCI in evaluation processes and grant applications. 

When you (your colleagues/collaborators) use data acquired, analysed or processed at the CCI in a publication, or use them in a grant application, the ***CCI must be acknowledged as part of VR-supported National Microscopy Infrastructure***. For example: 
> “We acknowledge the Centre for Cellular Imaging at the University of Gothenburg and the National Microscopy Infrastructure, NMI (VR-RFI 2023-00163) for providing assistance in microscopy”.

Publications encompass, but are not limited to, scientific papers, Bachelor-, Master- or PhD-theses as well as contributions to conferences. 

## 2. First-time user  

- Both you, as a User, and your Principal Investigator (PI) or Project Leader need to set up an account in the **CrossLab**, our core-management system. **CrossLab** is used for all CCI resource booking, registration, usage tracking, service requests, reporting and billing.
- The **CCI Registration Form**, which is found in CrossLab under “Request Services”, has to be completed and signed by both the user and their project leader before becoming a CCI user.  
- All research projects of national rank, i.e. where the advanced equipment at CCI facility is used to answer complex research questions, must be registered in the web portal of the [National Microscopy Infrastructure](https://nmi.scilifelab.se/). 
- The user must complete training by the CCI team before getting access to the microscopes and the CCI preparation lab, without exceptions. Usage of the CCI preparation lab is subject to the rules outlined in **Correct Labwork Procedure at the CCI** and **Risk Assessment documents** (contact CCI staff). 

> **IMPORTANT**
> Users cannot train new-users, and untrained guests may not operate the instruments/use the preparation lab! 

## 3. Training 

Based on their training and experience, users are divided into the following categories, and have different access rights to the CCI: 
- **First level**: During training and assisted usage. 
- **Second level**: Inexperienced trained users, who might need support and technical assistance. Access restricted to office hours (08.00-17.00). 
- **Third level**: Experienced trained users. No access restrictions. 

## 4. General rules 

 - **You are responsible** for the system during your booked session. **Inform the CCI Staff immediately if there are any problems with the equipment!** If you are also uncertain about something or cannot remember how to operate the system, please ask the CCI staff for advice.  
- Outside working hours (08.00-17.00) and on weekends/Holidays, ***only third level users*** (see Training) are allowed in the facility (microscope use and sample preparation). 
- No more than two people can work at the same workstation/microscope simultaneously. 
- Avoid turning microscope illumination sources (lasers, lamps, filaments, EHT) on and off more than once a day. Always look at the booking calendar to see if someone will come after you, and **follow microscope-specific guidelines from the CCI staff regarding how to turn on/off illumination sources and the whole system**.  
- **Keep the equipment and all working spaces clean!** After you finish, clean the objectives and remove all your belongings.
- If an instrument is not available due to technical issues or maintenance, it is blocked for booking. Affected users will be informed by e-mail or telephone and will be supported by CCI staff to perform their experiments on an alternative instrument if possible. 
- Access to the CCI preparation lab requires prior approval by the CCI staff for both working‑hours and out‑of‑hours use. 

## 5. Booking and pricing  

- **Booking** of the equipment in CrossLab before use **is mandatory**!  
- **Usage of microscopes and workstations is tracked via CrossLab and matched against the booking schedule.** Usage must be logged through the Kiosk web application. Charges are based on the greater of the booked time or the actual usage. If you finish earlier, you will still be charged for the booked duration; if you run over, the extra time will also be charged.  
- **No-show** (bookings that are not used and not cancelled in advance) will be charged for the full reserved time.  
- The microscopes will be charged charged in half-hour increments, with a minimum of one hour, i.e. working from 9.30-10.00 will count as an hour. 
- The systems can be **reserved up to 2 weeks in advance**, with a **maximum of 4 hours per session per day** (longer sessions require CCI approval). Booking 4-hour sessions on more than three days in the same week also requires approval. Long-term time-lapse experiments (over 5 hours) should be scheduled after 17.00 or arranged with CCI staff if assistance is needed.
- Cancellations: 
    - should be done as early as possible, minimum **24 hours** in advance to **avoid being charged**.
    - **on the same day, either due to sickness or experiment failure**, will be charged for 1hr by contacting the CCI staff **prior** the reservation.  
- Remember to **Log your usage**, please note that if the machine is booked and usage is not logged, it will be considered a no-show and charged for the whole booking period. 
- To ensure that all users stay up to date with our rules and equipment handling, booking privileges will be suspended if you have not used a system for more than one year. In that case, please contact CCI staff before your next session. We will support you during your first booking, and if needed, provide refresher training.  

## 6. Data handling 

- While acquiring images, save them in a folder titled with your full name in the **Users** folder, which you can access via the shortcut on the desktop of all microscope computers and workstations.  
- At the end of the imaging session, copy your images immediately to the ***CCI transfer server***. For the safety of the equipment, it is strictly forbidden to use USB sticks or any other external drives to transfer data.  
- All images present on the microscope computers older than **4 weeks** will be **automatically deleted**.
- Data transfer is allowed in only one direction: **FROM** the CCI computers **TO** the user's backup storage solution. The CCI transfer server is used only for transfer and short-term storage (max. **4** weeks), and must be regularly emptied after the images have been backed up. 
- The CCI transfer server may only be used for temporary storage of imaging data acquired at the CCI. It is not allowed to use the CCI transfer server for long-term storage or to store non-image data.  
- Once the data have been transferred from the CCI server to your storage solution ***you have full responsibility for the data***. This includes both storage and backup as well as correct handling (i.e. that no image manipulation/misconduct is performed) and interpretation.  
- Please contact the CCI staff if you would like to store your data on OMERO for extended period of time or utilise OMERO as an image analysis platform.  

## 7. Safety Policies 

- **Human tissue**: If working with human material, then you need to present a copy of the ethical permit before bringing any samples to the facility.  
- **Animal Use**: Users planning to use live animals in the facility must fill out the ”Permit to bring animals into the Centre for Cellular Imaging” form and follow the guidelines in that document.  
- **Biohazards and chemical hazards**
    - If you work with any hazardous (contagious, carcinogenic, radioactive, etc.) material ask the CCI staff if you are allowed to bring these into the facility and, if so, what precautions to take. 
    - Any surfaces that have come into contact with specimens that present a biosafety concern must be wiped off with the ethanol solution available in the facility. These surfaces include the instrument itself, the stage, holders, the focus knob, buttons, keyboard as well as the working areas around the instrument.  
    - Any waste, which needs to be taken care of as a biohazard (e.g. chemicals, human tissue, infected or genetically modified material), has to be brought back to the user’s own lab. 
    - Hazardous substances used in the CCI preparation lab have to be handled and disposed of as outlined in the EM lab training, EM lab Safety Handout, MSD sheets and risk assessments.  
    - Gloves are not allowed when operating any microscope at the CCI. All instruments are considered clean, and using gloves while handling them may transfer hazardous material to the equipment. Gloves may be used when handling samples, but must always be removed before touching the microscope. NOTE: ***Handling common equipment with contaminated gloves places all users of the facility at risk of exposure***
- ***Food and drinks are not allowed in any part of the CCI Facility***. If you need a refreshment while working in microscope rooms or preparation labs, please use one of the common lunch rooms at the Faculty.
